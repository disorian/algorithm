## 📝 Assessment Criteria for Session Completion

To consider a session complete and move to the next, you should:

1. ✅ Complete at least 80% of recommended practice problems
2. ✅ Implement required data structures from scratch with tests
3. ✅ Understand time/space complexity of all solutions
4. ✅ Solve at least 3-5 problems without looking at solutions
5. ✅ Review and understand multiple approaches to key problems

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Plan

1. Complete one session at a time (don't skip ahead)
2. Request session content by saying: **"Generate content for Session [number]"**
3. Update your progress in `learning-progress.md`
4. Take notes on challenging concepts
5. Review previous sessions periodically

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Consistency over intensity**: Regular practice (1-2 hours daily) beats marathon sessions
- **Understand, don't memorise**: Focus on understanding patterns, not memorising solutions
- **Write clean code**: Practice writing production-quality C# code, not just solutions that work
- **Time yourself**: Practice under time constraints to simulate interview conditions
- **Explain your solutions**: Teach concepts to solidify understanding
- **Review others' solutions**: Learn different approaches and optimisations
